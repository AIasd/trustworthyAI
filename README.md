# Trustworthy AI

This repository aims to include trustworthy AI related projects from Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. 
Current projects include:

- Causal Structure Learning

### Causal Structure Learning

- **Causal_Discovery_RL**:  codes, datasets, and training logs of the experimental results for the paper
 ['Causal discovery with reinforcement learning'](https://openreview.net/forum?id=S1g2skStPB), ICLR, 2020. (oral)
- **Datasets**: 
    - **Synthetic datasets**: codes for generating synthetic datasets used in the paper
    - **Real datasets**: a very challenging real dataset, to find causal structures based on 
    time series data. The true graph is obtained from expert knowledge. We welcome everyone to try this dataset and 
    report the result!

We will also release the codes of other gradient based causal structure learning methods.
